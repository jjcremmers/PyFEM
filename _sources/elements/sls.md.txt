# SLS (Solid-Like Shell)

The `SLS` element is an advanced shell element formulation for modeling laminated composite structures, layered materials, and sandwich panels where through-thickness behavior is important.

## Overview
- **Element type:** `SLS`
- **Supports:**
  - Multi-layer capability
  - Displacement-only formulation
  - Static condensation
  - Transverse shear deformation
  - Geometric nonlinearity
  - Composite materials

See documentation for details on parameters and usage.
