PyFEM is open source and intended for educational and scientific purposes only. If you use PyFEM in your research, the developers would be grateful if you could cite the book in your work.

## Goals and Scope

PyFEM aims to provide a clear, well-documented reference implementation for nonlinear finite element analysis, suited for teaching, prototyping, and reproducible research. The code emphasizes readability over micro-optimizations and includes a growing set of elements, material models, solvers, and I/O modules to cover common solid mechanics problems.

## How to Cite

If PyFEM contributes to a publication, please cite the textbook above and reference PyFEM (with the commit/tag or release) to ensure reproducibility. When applicable, include the specific modules (elements, materials, solvers) used in your study.
