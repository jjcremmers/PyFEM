# FiniteStrainContinuum

The `FiniteStrainContinuum` element is a displacement-based finite element for 2D and 3D large deformation analysis in continuum mechanics. This element formulation accounts for geometric nonlinearity through finite strain kinematics, making it suitable for problems involving large displacements, large rotations, and moderate to large strains.
