event caused by the use of the program.                                 

\section{Installation}

The code can be downloaded from the website that accompanies the book.

\begin{verbatim}
  http://www.wiley.com/go/deborst
\end{verbatim}
\noindent
On this website, both the current version X.Y as well as all previous major releases of the code
can be found. The code is packed as a \texttt{.zip} or a \texttt{.tar.gz} file and 
can be unzipped in a directory of choice. The latest development version is available on Github:

\texttt{https://github.com/jjcremmers/PyFEM}

This version of the \progname~is written to work properly in combination with 
\texttt{python} version 3.x. In addition, the code uses the modules \texttt{numpy}, \texttt{scipy} and
\texttt{matplotlib}. Installation guidelines are given for various operating systems.

\subsection{Windows OS (Windows XP and Windows 7)}

\begin{enumerate}
Various Python distributions for Windows are available. The one that is recommended is
\texttt{Anaconda}. Download the 32- or 64- bit version.

Alternatively, you cvan download Python3 and the individual mandatory modules:
\item Python is available at:
\begin{verbatim}
  http://www.python.org/getit
\end{verbatim} 
It is recommended to install the latest version 3.x.
\item Download and install \texttt{numpy}.
This module is available at:
\begin{verbatim}
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy
\end{verbatim}
It is recommended to install the latest version.
\item Download and install \texttt{scipy}.
This module is available at:
\begin{verbatim}
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/scipy/files/scipy/
\end{verbatim}
It is recommended to install the latest 32-bit version.
\item Download and install \texttt{matplotlib}.
This module is available at:
\begin{verbatim}
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/matplotlib/files/matplotlib/
\end{verbatim}
\item Run the python file \texttt{install.py} in the root directory 
by double-clicking it. It creates the required executables 
and returns the total path in which \progname~is installed. This path must be 
added to the environment variables \texttt{PYTHONPATH} and \texttt{PATH}. 

Windows has a built-in dialog for changing environment variables. In the case of Windows XP in
the classical view:
\begin{itemize} 
\item Click your machine (usually located on your Desktop 
and called “My Computer”) and choose Properties there. 
\item Then, open the Advanced tab and click the Environment 
Variables button.
\end{itemize} In short, your path is:
\begin{verbatim}
  My Computer->Properties->Advanced->Environment Variables
\end{verbatim}
In this dialog, you can add or modify user and system variables. 
To change system variables, you need non-restricted access to your machine (i.e. Administrator rights).

The main program \texttt{pyfem} can be run from the command prompt. For example, in order to run the
file \texttt{StressWave20x20.pro} in the directory \texttt{examples\textbackslash ch05}, simply type:
\begin{verbatim}
  pyfem StressWave20x20.pro
\end{verbatim}
or by clicking any \texttt{.pro} file with the right mouse button and selecting the batch file \texttt{pyfem.bat} 
to execute it with.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Linux OS}

The \texttt{python} program and the modules \texttt{numpy}, \texttt{scipy} and \texttt{matplotlib}
are included in most common distributions of Linux and can be installed without any problems. In many
cases, different versions of \texttt{python} are offered. Please make sure that \texttt{python} version 3.6 or higher is
installed.

\noindent Run de \texttt{python} file \texttt{install.py} in the root directory 
\texttt{pyfem-X.Y}. In a terminal, one can type:
\begin{verbatim}
  python install.py
\end{verbatim}
This script returns the total path in which \progname~is installed. This path must be 
added to the environment variables \texttt{PYTHONPATH} and \texttt{PATH}. When using a bash shell, 
the following lines have to be added to the file \texttt{.bashrc} in your root directory:
\begin{verbatim}
  export PYTHONPATH=<pyfemdir>
  alias  pyfem="python <pyfemdir>/PyFEM.py"
\end{verbatim}
When using csh or tcsh add the following lines to \texttt{.cshrc} or \texttt{.tcshrc}:
\begin{verbatim}
  setenv PYTHONPATH <pyfemdir>
  alias  pyfem "python <pyfemdir>/PyFEM.py"
\end{verbatim}
It goes without saying that in the case of multiple \texttt{PYTHONPATH} settings, the path to \progname~ 
should be added to existing paths. For example, in the case of a bash shell, this will look like:
\begin{verbatim}
  export PYTHONPATH=<pyfemdir>:$PYTHONPATH
\end{verbatim}
The main program \texttt{pyfem} can be run from the command prompt. For example, in order to run the
file \texttt{StressWave20x20.pro} in the directory \texttt{examples/ch05}, simply type:
\begin{verbatim}
  pyfem StressWave20x20.pro
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Mac OS}

\begin{enumerate}
\item The most recent versions of Apple Mac-OS ship with their own version of \texttt{python}. However, it is 
strongly recommended to install the official \texttt{python} 3.x at: 
\begin{verbatim}
  http://www.python.org/getit
\end{verbatim} 
The latest version is 3.x
\item Download and install the latest version of \texttt{numpy}.
This module is available at:
\begin{verbatim}
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/NumPy
\end{verbatim}
It is recommended to install the latest version, which is 1.6.2.
\item Download and install \texttt{scipy}.
This module is available at:
\begin{verbatim}
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/scipy/files/scipy/
\end{verbatim}
It is recommended to install the latest version, which is 0.11.01b.
\item Download and install \texttt{matplotlib}.
This module is available at:
\begin{verbatim}
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/matplotlib/files/matplotlib/
\end{verbatim}
It is recommended to install the latest version, which is version 1.1.0.
\item When all programs and packages mentioned above are installed, open a terminal and run 
the \texttt{python} file \texttt{install.py} in the root directory \texttt{pyfem-X.Y}, by typing:
\begin{verbatim}
  python install.py
\end{verbatim}
This script returns the total path in which \progname~is installed. This path must be 
added to the environment variables \texttt{PYTHONPATH} and \texttt{PATH}. The following lines 
have to be added to the file \texttt{.bashrc} in your root directory:
\begin{verbatim}
  export PYTHONPATH="your_pyfem_path"
  alias  pyfem     ="python your_pyfem_path/PyFEM.py"
\end{verbatim}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Additional software}

\progname~can store the solution of a simulation in the \texttt{vtk}-format, which can be viewed with the 
program \textsc{Paraview}. This program is available for free for academic use from the following 
website\footnote{Please read the terms on their website in case of non-academic use.}:
\begin{verbatim}
  http://www.paraview.org
\end{verbatim} 
The results are stored as a single \texttt{.pvd} file, which refers to a number of \texttt{.vtu} files. By opening
the \texttt{.pvd} file in \textsc{Paraview} one can see the deformed mesh and stress contours, as shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig:stress}. A more detailed description how to create these output files is given in paragraph~\ref{par:vtk}.

\begin{figure}
\centering\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{img/screen.eps}
\caption{Screen shot of the results of the simulation \texttt{StressWave20x20.pro} shown in \textsc{Paraview}.}
\label{fig:stress}
\end{figure}

\section{Quick start}

In order to test whether everything is installed properly, the following two simulations can be run.

\subsection*{Simple example} 

In the directory \texttt{examples/ch02} the script \texttt{PatchTest.py} can be executed from a terminal (or DOS-shell) by typing:
\begin{verbatim}
  python PatchTest.py
\end{verbatim}
In Windows, this script can also be executed by double-clicking the icon.

\subsection*{\textsc{PyFEM} example} 

The full finite element code \progname~can be run by typing \texttt{pyfem} in the terminal. In directory \texttt{examples/ch04} for example,
the input file \texttt{ShallowTrussRiks.pro} is processed by typing:
\begin{verbatim}
  pyfem ShallowTrussRiks.pro
\end{verbatim}
Here, \texttt{ShallowTrussRiks.pro} is the input file, which by definition ends with \texttt{.pro}. When it is
opened in a text editor, it looks as follows:

\begin{graybox}
\begin{verbatim}
  input = "ShallowTrussRiks.dat";

  TrussElem  = 
  {
    ....
  };

  SpringElem =
  {
    ....
  };

  solver =
  {
    ....
  };

  outputModules = ["graph"];

  graph = 
  {
    ....
  };
\end{verbatim}
\end{graybox}
The dots indicate lines that have been omitted in this example.
The first argument in the \texttt{.pro}-file specifies the input file, which contains the positions of 
the nodes, the element connectivity and the boundary conditions. The structure of this file, which normally has 
the extension \texttt{.dat}, is as follows:
\begin{graybox}
\begin{verbatim}
  <Nodes>
    1   0.0 0.0 ;
    2 -10.0 0.0 ;
    3  10.0 0.0 ;
    4   0.0 0.5 ;
  </Nodes>

  <Elements>
    1 'TrussElem' 2 4 ;
    2 'TrussElem' 3 4 ;
    3 'SpringElem' 1 4 ;
  </Elements>

  <NodeConstraints>
    u[1] = 0.0;
    u[2] = 0.0;
    u[3] = 0.0;

    v[1] = 0.0;
    v[2] = 0.0;
    v[3] = 0.0;
  </NodeConstraints>

  <ExternalForces>
    v[4] = -100.0 ;
  </ExternalForces>
\end{verbatim}
\end{graybox}	
The nodes are defined between the labels \texttt{<Nodes>} and \texttt{</Nodes>}. The first number 
indicates the node identification number. The remaining numbers denote the coordinates in $x$-, $y$-, and in the 
case of a three dimensional simulation, the $z$-direction. For example, node 2 has the $x$ and $y$ coordinates $(-10,0)$.

The element connectivity is given after the tag \texttt{<Elements>}. 
The first number indicates the element ID number. The string refers to the name of the
element model this element belongs to. The remaining numbers are the nodes that are used to construct 
the element. In this example, the first element is of the type \texttt{'TrussElem'} and is supported
by nodes 2 and 4.

The boundary conditions and applied loads are specified next. The node constraints are given after the label \texttt{<NodeConstraints>}. 
In this example, the displacement components \texttt{u} and
\texttt{v} of nodes 1,2 and 3 have a prescribed value of 0.0. The external forces are specified in a 
similar manner in the field \texttt{<ExternalForces>}. Here, a unit external force with magnitude -100.0 is
added to node number 4 in the direction that corresponds to the \texttt{'v'} displacement. Hence, this force is
acting in the negative $y$-direction.

The parameters of the finite element model are specified in the \texttt{.pro} file, 
in the fields \texttt{TrussElem} and \texttt{SpringElem}, which refer to the labels used in the element connectivity
description.

\begin{graybox}
\begin{verbatim}
  TrussElem  = 
  {
    type = "Truss";
    E    = 5e6;
    Area = 1.0;
  };

  SpringElem =
  {
    type = "Spring";
    k    = 100.0;
  };
\end{verbatim}
\end{graybox}
The elements denoted by the label \texttt{TrussElem} are of the type \texttt{'Truss'}. This model requires two
additional parameters, the Young's modulus of the material \texttt{E} and the area of the cross-section \texttt{Area}.
The label \texttt{SpringElem} denote elements of the type \texttt{'Spring'}. Here, one additional parameter is required: the
spring stiffness \texttt{k}. A detailed overview of the element types and the corresponding parameters can be found in Section~\ref{sec:elements}
of this manual.

\vspace{2mm}
\noindent
The parameters of the solver are defined next:

\begin{graybox}
\begin{verbatim}
  solver =
  {
    type = 'RiksSolver';

    fixedStep = true;
    maxLam    = 10.0; 
  };
\end{verbatim}
\end{graybox}
The solver is of the type \texttt{'RikSolver'}. The two additional parameters specify that the magnitude of the path-parameter is
constant (\texttt{fixedStep = true}) and that the simulation is stopped when the load parameter $\lambda$ reaches a value of 10.0. 
A detailed overview of available solver types and their parameters is given in Section~\ref{sec:solver}.

Finally, the results of the simulation can be stored and visualised in several ways. To this end, a chain of output modules can be 
specified. In this example, the results are stored in a load-displacement curve in the module \texttt{GraphWriter}.

\begin{graybox}
\begin{verbatim}
  outputModules = ["graph"];

  graph =
  {
    type     = "GraphWriter";
    onScreen = true;

    columns = [ "disp" , "load" ];

    disp =
    {
      type   = "state";
      node   = 4;
      dof    = 'v';
      factor = -1.0;
    };
  
    load =
    { 
      type = "fint";
      node = 4;
      dof  = 'v';
    };
  };
\end{verbatim}
\end{graybox}
In this example, two colums are stored: \texttt{'disp'}, the displacement (\texttt{'state'}) of node 4 in the vertical 
direction and \texttt{'load'}, the corresponding internal force. The parameter \texttt{onScreen = true} is used
to show the load-displacement curve on the screen during the simulation. By default, the results will be stored in a file called
\texttt{ShallowTrussRiks.out}. A description of all available output 
modules can be found in Section~\ref{sec:output}.
