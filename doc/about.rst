The code is open source and intended for educational and scientific
purposes only. If you use PyFEM in your research, the developers would
be grateful if you could cite the book in your work.

Goals and scope
---------------

PyFEM aims to provide a clear, well-documented reference implementation for
nonlinear finite element analysis, suited for teaching, prototyping, and
reproducible research. The code emphasizes readability over micro-optimizations
and includes a growing set of elements, material models, solvers, and I/O
modules to cover common solid mechanics problems.

How to cite
-----------

If PyFEM contributes to a publication, please cite the textbook above and
reference PyFEM (with the commit/tag or release) to ensure reproducibility.
When applicable, include the specific modules (elements, materials, solvers)
used in your study.
